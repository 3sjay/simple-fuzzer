## Info

Simple commandline fuzzer written in rust for tools who parse local files.
It's mainly written for OSX but with minor modifications will run on any platform.

We are making use of ramdisk to enhance the fuzzing speed a bit.

Hence execute the following commands before running the fuzzer (path currently hardcoded)
```
diskutil erasevolume HFS+ 'RAMDisk' `hdiutil attach -nomount ram://4388608`
mkdir /Volumes/RAMDisk/ramstuff
```

Run the fuzzer on some binary,
arg[1] => corpus
arg[2] => tool to fuzz
arg[n] => other commandline paramters
arg[n+1] => (will be added by the fuzzer automatically) is the mutated file on the ramdisk
```
# cargo run ~/fun/fuzz/targets/targetbin/corpus  ~/fun/fuzz/targets/assetutil/CARParser 
```

The libgmalloc is used to hopefully find more heap related bugs, here the cmd for easily retesting the bug
```
# DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=/usr/lib/libgmalloc.dylib
```
